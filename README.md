Personalized Voice Assistant with GPT and Whisper
Overview
This project aims to create a personalized voice assistant using OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model and Whisper technology. The voice assistant is designed to understand natural language commands, generate human-like responses, and adapt its responses based on user interactions.

Features
Natural Language Understanding: The voice assistant utilizes GPT to understand and interpret user commands in natural language.
Human-like Responses: GPT generates responses that mimic human-like conversation, providing a more engaging user experience.
Personalization: The assistant learns from user interactions to personalize responses and tailor recommendations over time.
Whisper Technology: Whisper technology enhances privacy by processing user data locally, ensuring sensitive information remains secure.
Modular Architecture: The system is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easy integration of additional features and customization.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenAI GPT API key
Whisper SDK
Microphone and speaker setup
