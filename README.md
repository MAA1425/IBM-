Personalized Voice Assistant with GPT and Whisper
Overview
This project aims to create a personalized voice assistant using OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model and Whisper technology. The voice assistant is designed to understand natural language commands, generate human-like responses, and adapt its responses based on user interactions.

Features
Natural Language Understanding: The voice assistant utilizes GPT to understand and interpret user commands in natural language.
Human-like Responses: GPT generates responses that mimic human-like conversation, providing a more engaging user experience.
Personalization: The assistant learns from user interactions to personalize responses and tailor recommendations over time.
Whisper Technology: Whisper technology enhances privacy by processing user data locally, ensuring sensitive information remains secure.
Modular Architecture: The system is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easy integration of additional features and customization.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenAI GPT API key
Whisper SDK
Microphone and speaker setup
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/voice-assistant.git
Install dependencies.
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Obtain an API key for OpenAI GPT and update the configuration file with your credentials.
Install Whisper SDK and configure it for local processing of user data.
Usage
Run the voice assistant application.
Copy code
python voice_assistant.py
The assistant will start listening for user commands. Speak clearly and naturally to interact with the assistant.
The assistant will process the command, generate a response using GPT, and provide the output through the speaker.
Customization
Adding Skills: Extend the functionality of the assistant by adding new skills/modules tailored to specific tasks or domains.
Training GPT: Fine-tune the GPT model on specific datasets to improve its understanding and generate more relevant responses.
User Preferences: Implement mechanisms to capture and incorporate user preferences for personalized interactions.
