# Music Generation Project

## Overview
This project aims to generate music using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of MIDI files and is capable of producing new compositions in a given style or genre.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: The MIDI files are preprocessed to extract musical features such as notes, chords, and durations.
- **Model Architecture**: The music generation model is based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.
- **Training**: The model is trained on a dataset of MIDI files using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Generation**: Once trained, the model can generate new musical sequences either from scratch or based on a given seed input.
- **Evaluation**: Generated music can be evaluated using metrics such as musicality, coherence, and similarity to the training data.

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-generation.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Download Dataset**: Obtain MIDI files for training the model. These can be sourced from online repositories or generated synthetically.
4. **Preprocessing**: Run the preprocessing script to extract musical features from the MIDI files.
5. **Training**: Train the model using the preprocessed data.
6. **Generation**: Generate new music using the trained model.

## Usage
- **Preprocessing Script**: `python preprocess.py --input_dir <input_directory> --output_dir <output_directory>`
- **Training Script**: `python train.py --data_dir <data_directory> --model_dir <model_directory>`
- **Generation Script**: `python generate.py --model_path <model_path> --output_dir <output_directory>`

## Example
To generate music in the style of classical piano:
1. Preprocess classical piano MIDI files.
2. Train the model on the preprocessed data.
3. Generate new piano compositions using the trained model.

## Acknowledgments
- The code architecture and implementation are inspired by similar projects in the field of music generation.
